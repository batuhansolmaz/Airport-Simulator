# Airport-Simulator

Aviation makes the dream and desire of being able to fly a reality. A strong and affordable global air
transport network transcends continents, greatly expands local access to foreign supplies and markets, provides invaluable opportunities for cultural and social exchange, and enhances emergency and humanitarian
response capabilities during crises and public health emergencies. All these opportunities and many more
depend on the flawless execution of our flight operations.
Air traffic management is a cooperative, international effort and does not stop at borders, on land
or in the air. International cooperation of air traffic control providers has helped make commercial aircraft
one of the most rapid and dependable mode of travel. Flight operations staff work around the clock to
ensure the smooth running of these services. In this project, you will explore these flight operations servicesâ€™
event-driven flight scheduling and processing routines.
